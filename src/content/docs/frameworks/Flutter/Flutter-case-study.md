## Introduction

## Brief History

## About & Features

Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google, and is used by developers to build an application's UI for multiple platforms using a single codebase. According to Amazon Web Services, Flutter simplifies the process of creating consistent, appealing UIs for an application across the six platforms it supports. Which means that even though Flutter embraces different platforms, it still originates from a single codebase. One can consider Flutter as both native app development and cross-platform development. Flutter gives you the opportunity to make applications for iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux and IoT-devices using a single codebase.

### Dart

Flutter uses the open source language Dart, which is also developed by Google. Dart is designed to be efficient, east to learn and highly suitable for making UI's. Dart supports both JIT (just-In-Time) and AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, allowing the dev team to use hot reload for rapid development and produce native code for production. Dart seems extensive at first but after learning the architecture of the code it was quite simple and easy to learn, it also has extensions and IDE support in VSC.

### Widgets

"Everything is a widget" - A complete guide to Flutter architecture.

A widget is a fundamental building block in flutter and includes visual elements like buttons, texts and images but also structure, padding, and even the entire application itself. The widgets are organized in a hierarchy known as the "widget tree" and is a never ending chain of parent and child elements that eventually create the layout of your app. There are two different types of widgets, stateless and stateful widgets.

- Stateless Widgets are unchanging parts of the app. They are used for things that does not move or react, like displaying a simple message og an image.

- Stateful Widgets are the parts of the app that can change and react to what the user does. Like a button that changes color when you press it.

Flutter comes with an extensive widget catalog, like styling, layouts and themes.

### Flutter Doctor

While its not considered a feature it is a strong command-line tool used to diagnose the development environment. You can use Flutter Doctor to check the status of your installation, identify missing dependencies and provide guidance to resolve issues. When you run the flutter doctor command it checks your system for required dependencies such as the Flutter SDK, Dart SDK, Android studio and more. If there are any issues it also guides you on how to fix them and even provide links to installation guides or advice you to run specific commands in the terminal. It also verifies that you are connected to your devices or emulators which are crucial for testing. Regularly running "flutter doctor" is a good practice to ensure that your development environment is healthy and up to date.

## Strengths

## Weaknesses

Like every other tool, Flutter also has weaknesses. Applications built with flutter tend to be larger than those built with native tools. This can be a concern when aiming to minimize download sizes. You will also meet limited third-party libraries. Flutter is growing but all things considered it is still a new framework so libraries might seem limited compared to other well established frameworks. It being new also speaks for its establishment in larger corporations which also will be limited but ever growing.
The dart programming language can be challenging for some developers and there might be a steep learning curve.
Flutter faces web development inefficiencies with loading speeds and SEO. The limited WebView support can be a pain point for developers aiming for nuanced web interactions.
